step 1: Take the dough out and roll it into a circle

step 2: Puff out the edge of the dough so the crust is thicker at the edge

step 3: Pre-heat oven to 250-260 degrees C. (Remember to put a pizza stone in the oven)

step 4: Put on the pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.

step 5: Put the pizza on the pizza stone in the oven.

step 6:Bake for 30 minutes or until pizza is crispy and golden brown. (make sure you don't burn the toppings)

step 7:Try putting the toppings on the pizza differently to make the pizza look cool! (you can also change the shape of your pizza such as square or triangle)

step 8:Enjoy your homemade pizza!!!
